# Hbt-TDLAS-secondHarmonic

**A Hilbert transform-based TDLAS second harmonic demodulation method, without reference signal.**

The second harmonic in the field of wavelength modulation spectroscopy is of critical importance in the detection of gas in biomedical science, such as exhaled breath carbon dioxide.
 
Conventionally, lock-in amplifier is used to demodulate the second harmonic, and it requires reference signal, which is very inconvenient. 

We presents a method to demodulate the second harmonic without reference signal. As no reference signal is required, the proposed method benefits second harmonic demodulation with convenient operation and efficiency.
